# Semester_Project
The Old Age Home Management System is a C++ project that applies arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, and binary search trees to manage residents, track health records, and rotate staff duties. It streamlines elderly care by combining data handling, health monitoring, and scheduling into one efficient platform.
